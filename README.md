# Word-Guess-Game

This is a hang-man-like game written in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created as a project for my DevBootCamp

Hit start, and press any letters on your keyboard to guess the hidden word with the help of the provided hint

Please note of a bug on Google Chrome that sometimes cuts the audio short upon winning the game
